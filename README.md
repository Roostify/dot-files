# Dotfiles
In order to make our lives a teeny-tiny bit more consistent, useful shared dotfile stuff will be added here.

## Usage

1. Install homeshick https://github.com/andsens/homeshick
2. Clone this repo with homeshick: `homeshick clone git@github.com:Roostify/roostify-dotfiles.git`
3. Symlink these via: `homeshick link roostify-dotfiles`
4. Add `source $HOME_PATH/.roostify/bash_profile` to `~/.bash profile`.
5. Add `source $HOME_PATH/.roostify/bash_profile_extensions/<file_name>` for each of the extensions you're interested in.
6. Profit?
